                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>Reece grew up in <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">Santa Cruz</span>, <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">California</span>. He is the youngest of three, with each brother
                    being five years apart from the next. His father and mother always promoted education and he was raised with an
                    ethical foundation that emphasizes the importance of doing whatâ€™s right. Reece's family values <span style="color: lightgreen;">humility</span>, <span style="color: lightgreen;">responsibility</span>,
                    and <span style="color: lightgreen;">punctuality</span>. Reece has always approached situations in life with a lighthearted attitude and a smile, with the belief that
                    <span style="color: lightgreen;">patience</span>, <span style="color: lightgreen;">kindness</span>, and <span style="color: lightgreen;">dedication</span> could overcome any obstacle. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Parents' Influence</h3>
                <p>
                    As a child, Reece was introduced to a lot of activities that he still enjoys today. His father taught him how to surf and play basketball
                    at an early age, and his mother taught him how to take care of himself. Not only did they encourage Reece to be a 
                    <span style="color: lightgreen;"></span>well-rounded person, but they instilled the idea that he should be <span style="color: lightgreen;">self-sufficient</span style="color: lightgreen;"> instead of primarily relying on 
                    others. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>
                    Reece's ethnicity is mixed, consisting of <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">African American</span>, <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">Hispanic</span>, 
                    <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">Chinese</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">Caucasian</span>. Growing up, Reece was primarily culturally immersed
                    in the Chinese culture, practicing Cantonese traditions and customs. Reece did not learn Cantonese, but instead has been practicing Spanish throughout his 
                    school years with hopes of becoming fully bilingual. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Early Tech</h3>
                <p>
                    Reece was always interested in and curious about technology. As a kid, he would get in trouble with his parents for jailbreaking his phone. Rightfully so, since his 
                    parents were paying for his phone bill and he was voiding the warranty. When he turned 13, he built his first PC, gaining his first experience with 
                    computer architecture. From there, he attended a computer programming camp at <span style="color: rgb(236, 238, 144);">Stanford</span>, which sparked his passion for software development.
