                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>
                    In his early years of school, Reece played basketball as a shooting guard and ran track in the 100m sprints and 4x4 400m sprints.
                    In high school, he shifted his focus to wrestling, enjoying the independent aspect of the sport. From there, Reece became addicted to going to weightlifting and staying fit,
                    and he makes an effort to go to the gym multiple times a week. Reece also loves long board surfing, enjoying the mellow and tranquil nature of the sport.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    When Reece was in his sophmore year of high school, he joined beginning band playing the trombone. He worked his way into varsity band his following year, and even played in jazz and marching band.
                    Reece loved the school events he played in and the community the band offered. From there, his love of music was expanded and he began writing and producing his own music and lyrics. He mainly creates 
                    R&B and Hip-Hop music, but like computer programming, he enjoys all genres of music to some degree. For Reece, creating music is therapuetic, and an outlet that allows him to express his thoughts creatively.
